# Epic-fields-vos
This repo contains the baselines for semi-supervised VOS (EPIC FIELDS) and how to use replicate the results reported in the paper.

## Dataset Structure
To run the training or evaluation scripts, the dataset format should be as follows (following [DAVIS](https://davischallenge.org/) format), a script is given in the next step to convert VISOR to DAVIS-like dataset.
```

|- VISOR_2022
  |- val_data_mapping.json
  |- train_data_mapping.json
  |- JPEGImages
  |- Annotations
  |- ImageSets
     |- 2022
        |- train.txt
        |- val.txt
        |- val_unseen.txt
```
For more information on how to get such a format, please visit [VISOR-VOS repository](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/VISOR-VOS)

## Fixed2D Baseline

The `fixed_2d.py` runs the **Fixed2D** baseline. The script take these parameters:

### Parameters:

- `--output-folder`: Specifies the directory where the processed sequences will be saved. The default is `outputs/fixed2d`.

- `--visor-root`: Points to the root directory of the VISOR dataset. The default path is `datasets/VISOR_2022`.

The results will be stored under <output-folder>  directory. 


## Fixed3D Baseline

The `fixed_3d.py` runs the **Fixed3D** baseline. The script take these parameters:

### Parameters:

- `--output-folder`: Specifies the directory where the processed sequences will be saved. The default is `outputs/fixed3d`.

- `--visor-root`: Points to the root directory of the VISOR dataset. The default path is `datasets/VISOR_2022`.

- `--dense-models-root`: Indicates the directory containing the EPIC FIELDS dense models. 

- `--visor-to-epic`: Specifies the path to the file that maps any VISOR frame to its corresponding EPIC-KITCHENS frame. By default, it's set to `frame_mapping_train_val.json` (included as part of the repo).

- `--epic-to-visor`: Determines the path to the file that maps the EPIC-KITCHENS frames to VISOR frames. The default file is `frame_mapping_train_val_epic_to_visor.json`(included as part of the repo).

The results will be stored under <output-folder>  directory. 

## Evaluation
In order to evaluate your semi-supervised method in VISOR we use [VISOR evaluation script](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/VISOR-VOS/tree/b6afe07691fad922ebacb42654046ef24a0fe3ba/evaldavis2017), execute the following command substituting `results/sample` by the folder path that contains your results:
```bash
python evaluation_method.py --task semi-supervised --results_path results/sample
```
